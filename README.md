This is the readme file for the processing of stimulation related data in human electocorticography datasets. The data is written in MATLAB, and should require no special packages for use.

To use example data and to have all of the code required to perform the processing, clone the github repository, and download the data in the google drive link below. Place the data in a folder that is in the working directory.

The script to call and run section by section is:
artifact_rejection_script.m

The helper_functions folder contains helper plotting and processing functions that prove useful in visualizing the data here, and with modifications may prove useful to other researchers.

The analysis_functions folder contains the bulk of the analysis functions called for processing human stimulation electrocorticography data.
