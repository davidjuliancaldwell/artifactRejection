    % plots the condensed cluster tree as a connected 
    % graph, based on the relationship between parent clusters
    % and all sub clusters from the parent
    %
    % Inputs:
    %   tree - a cluster tree created by HDBSCAN.fit() or hdbscan_fit
    %
    % Outputs:
    %   G - the graph object created by linking a parent with all 
    %       sub clusters spawning from the parent
    %
    %   h - the handle to the figure
