% DBSCAN DBSCAN clustering algorithm
%
% Usage:  [C, ptsC, centres] = dbscan(P, E, minPts, distanceMetric)
%
% Arguments:
%         P - dim x Npts array of points.
%         E - Distance threshold.
%    minPts - Minimum number of points required to form a cluster.
% distanceMetric - distance metric to use. Options include Euclidean, Cosine
%             similarity, and correlation
%
% Returns:
%         C - Cell array of length Nc listing indices of points associated with
%             each cluster.
%      ptsC - Array of length Npts listing the cluster number associated with
%             each point.  If a point is denoted as noise (not enough nearby
%             elements to form a cluster) its cluster number is 0.
%   centres - dim x Nc array of the average centre of each cluster.
